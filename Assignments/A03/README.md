1. **Class** - an extensible program-code-template for creating objects, 
               providing member variables and member functions or methods

2. **Object** - refers to a particular instance of a class; can be a 
                combination of variables, functions, and data structures
                
3. **Method** - defines the behavior of the objects that are created from 
                the class
                
4. **Abstraction** - the act of representing essential features without 
                     including the background details or explanations
                     
5. **Encapsulation** - bundling data and methods that work on that data within 
                       one unit; used to hide the internal representation, or 
                       state, of an object from the outside
                       
6. **Polymorphism** - provision of a single interface to entities of different 
                      types or the use of a single symbol to represent multiple 
                      different types
                      
7. **Overloading** - whereby operators treated as polymorphic functions having 
                     different behaviours depending on the types of arguments used
                     
8. **Attributes / Properties** - a specification that defines a property of an 
                                 object, element, or file
                                 
9. **Class Variable** - a variable defined in a class of which a single copy exists, 
                        regardless of how many instances of the class exist
                        
10. **Instance Variable** - a variable defined in a class, for which each 
                            instantiated object of the class has a separate copy
                            
11. **Member Variable** - a variable that is associated with a specific object, 
                          and accessible for all its methods
                          
12. **Inheritance** - allows a class to have the same behavior as another 
                      class and extend or tailor that behavior to provide 
                      special action for specific needs
                      
13. **Multiple Inheritance** - a feature in which an object or class can inherit 
                               characteristics and features from more than one 
                               parent object or parent class
                               
14. **Composition** - a way to combine simple objects or data types into more 
                      complex ones
